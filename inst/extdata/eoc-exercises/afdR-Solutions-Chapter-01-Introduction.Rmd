## Exercises

01. Use [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=R+groups+in+my+city) to search for R groups in your region. Verify if there are frequent meetings and, if you so desire, go to one and make new friends.

02. Once you have R and RStudio installed, head over to the [CRAN package website](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html) and search for computer technologies that you use in your current work. For example, if you use [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) extensively in your work, you'll soon find that there is a package in CRAN that can interact with it by creating and reading cloud based spreadsheets. You'll probably be surprised with the results. 

03. Go to the [RBloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) website and search for a topic of your interest, such as, "Tennis" or "investments". Read at least two or three articles that interest you.
